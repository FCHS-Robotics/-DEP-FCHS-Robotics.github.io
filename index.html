/*
try to set up a board
this is just to get an idea of how it will work
chess
if you have good ideas for how this will work then type them
if we both work on it then we might be able to do it

ai-
each position has a number
the number represents how benifitial it would be to go there
the higher the number, the better it would be
the lower the number, the worse it would be
0 = enemy pieces can go there and is not guarded by frienly pieces
1 = enemy piece is there, but guarded by enemy pieces
2 = enemy pieces can go there and is guarded by friendly pieces
3 = nothing can take it and none of the ai's pieces are guarding it
4 = in position to take a piece
5 = is guarded by friendly pieces
6 = is guarded by friendly pieces and in position to take a piece
7 = a peice is taken and is not guard by anything
8 = a peice is taken and guarded by frienly pieces
each peice has an importance level
if the importance level of frienly piece is lower than an enemy piece then it will take it if the position number is 1 or 2
the computer will not sacrifice peices if it has less than an ideal number of importance levels combined
