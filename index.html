/*
what are the last three numbers of your student id so i can share a doc with you
if you have good ideas for how this will work then type them
if we both work on it then we might be able to do it

ai-
each position has a number
the number represents how benifitial it would be to go there
the higher the number, the better it would be
the lower the number, the worse it would be
0 = enemy pieces can go there and is not guarded by frienly pieces
1 = enemy piece is there, but guarded by enemy pieces
2 = enemy pieces can go there and is guarded by friendly pieces
3 = nothing can take it and none of the ai's pieces are guarding it
4 = in position to take a piece
5 = is guarded by friendly pieces
6 = is guarded by friendly pieces and in position to take a piece
7 = a piece is taken and is not guard by anything
8 = a piece is taken and guarded by frienly pieces
each piece has an importance level
if the importance level of frienly piece is lower than an enemy piece then it will take it if the position number is 1 or 2
the computer will not sacrifice peices if it has less than an ideal number of importance levels combined
the ai move function will return the number of where it will go
it will take the piece on each position and use that to calculate the number of each position
then it will choose the highest number,if there are multiple, it will randomize it
function aimove(pos,pos1,pos2,pos3,pos4,pos5,pos6,pos7,pos8,pos9,(up until 64)){}
i shared a google doc with you so we can work on this live
